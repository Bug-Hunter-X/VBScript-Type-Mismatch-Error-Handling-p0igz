This repository demonstrates a common VBScript error: the type mismatch error. The `bug.vbs` file contains code that might throw this error. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.vbs` demonstrating proper error handling and type checking.  The original code lacks comprehensive error handling, making it prone to crashes. The solution includes explicit checks to prevent type mismatches and provides more informative error messages.
